  - RampantLeaf: Provider of EM1 level loader data.
  - SlayCap: Heavy contributor & Provider of EM2 level loader data.
  - Wiimm: Creator of WIT, which EML relies on for extracting .ISO files (https://github.com/Wiimm/wiimms-iso-tools)
  - Nanook: Creator of the NKit tools, which eml relies on for converting NKIT isos into normal isos (https://github.com/Nanook/NKitv1)
  - Function Point: Awesome Edition.
  - All EML users: At age 14, I did not expect my tiny dinky project to take off and do so well. It's been a really fun learning project, and I have way more in store for the future. Thank you all.
